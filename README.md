# Music Library API Project - Overview

This project is about creating a Music Library API, which stores information about artists, albums, and songs. This was one of the major projects for the backend section of the bootcamp and had us create a CRUD REST API using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize. We also used tools such a Postman and MySQL Workbench to interact with our work and view and manipulate the database.

## Technologies

* Mocha / Chai
* Node.js
* Express
* JavaScript
* Postman
* MySQL Workbench
* Sequelize

## Concepts

* Databases
* Database Design
* SQL
* MySQL
* Sequelize
* Database Querying and CRUD operations

## Learning objectives

* Explain what a data schema is
    * Represents any structure that we're defining around the data, such as tables and relationships. We defined data schemas for each item (artists, albums, and songs) in their own files and then made the connections between these three items in the *index.js* file in the *models* section.
* Design and implement an API with CRUD operations on a database
    * This project was focused on creating an API utilizing CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. This was accomplished using the HTTP protocol equivalents (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE). These directions that we created ensured that when the HTTP requests were made the appropriate response would be returned from the API. We used Postman and MySQL Workbench to test and then see that we were getting the appropriate responses.

# Getting Started

Fork and clone the repo and then run `npm test` in the file to ensure all tests pass.

Then run `npm start` which will fire up the Express app at `http://localhost:4000`.

Open up Postman and MySQL Workbench in order to check work / requests.

## Artists Section

### Artists POST

Ensure that your request is set to `POST` and that you add `/artists` to your Postman route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/artists`).

In the `Body` section, click `raw` and ensure the `text` is set to `JSON`.

Type in the field: 

> {
>
>    "name": "Tame Impala",
>
>    "genre": "Rock"
>
> }

(Or type whatever artists / genres you like!)

Click the `Send` button and in the section below you will see your results!

### Artists GET

Ensure that your request is set to `GET` and that you add `/artists` to your Postman route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/artists`).

In the `Body` section click `none` and then click the `Send` button. You will see all the results for the artists you have added!

If you want to look at one specific artist and not the entire list add the id of the artist you want to see to your route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/artists/1`). To make sure the error message is working but in an id for an artist that you know doesn't exist (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/artists/12345`). You should get the error message: 

> 'The artist could not be found.'

### Artists PATCH

Ensure that your request is set to `PATCH` and that you add `/artists/:id` to your Postman route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/artists/1`).

In the `Body` section make sure the text is set to `raw` and `JSON`. Try changing either the `name` or `genre` values. For example:

> {
>
>    "name": "The Flaming Lips"
>
>}

OR

> {
>
>    "genre": "Pop"
>
> }

In your response body you should see the number 1 - this means that the file has been updated (there has been one change). To see your changes, make another GET request!

Make sure the error for this works by adding an artist route you know doesn't exist (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/artists/12345`) and you should see the message: 

> 'The artist could not be found.'

### Artists DELETE

Ensure that your request is set to `DELETE` and that you add `/artists/:id` to your Postman route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/artists/1`).

In the `Body` section click `none` and then click the `Send` button. You will see all the results for the artists you have added!

Do a GET request to make sure that the artist no longer exists: 'The artist could not be found.'

Make sure the error for this works by adding an artist route you know doesn't exist (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/artists/12345`) and you should see the message: 

> 'The artist could not be found.'

## Albums Section

### Albums POST

Ensure that your request is set to `POST` and that you add `/artists/:artistId/albums` to your Postman route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/artists/1/albums`).

In the `Body` section, click `raw` and ensure the `text` is set to `JSON`.

Type in the field: 

> {
>
>    "name": "InnerSpeak",
>
>    "year": "2010"
>
> }

(Or type whatever albums / years you like!)

Click the `Send` button and in the section below you will see your results!

### Albums GET

Ensure that your request is set to `GET` and that you add `/albums` to your Postman route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/albums`).

In the `Body` section click `none` and then click the `Send` button. You will see all the results for the albums you have added!

If you want to look at one specific album and not the entire list add the id of the album you want to see to your route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/albums/1`). To make sure the error message is working put in an id for an album that you know doesn't exist (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/albums/12345`). You should get the error message: 

> 'The album could not be found.'

### Albums PATCH

Ensure that your request is set to `PATCH` and that you add `/albums/:id` to your Postman route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/albums/1`).

In the `Body` section make sure the text is set to `raw` and `JSON`. Try changing either the `name` or `year` values. For example:

> {
>
>    "name": "Empty Streets"
>
> }

OR

> {
>
>    "year": 1983
>
> }

In your response body you should see the number 1 - this means that the file has been updated (there has been one change). To see your changes, make another GET request!

Make sure the error for this works by adding an album route you know doesn't exist (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/albums/12345`) and you should see the message: 

> 'The album could not be found.'

Ensure that your request is set to `DELETE` and that you add `/albums/:id` to your Postman route (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/albums/1`).

In the `Body` section click `none` and then click the `Send` button. In your response body you should see the number 1 - this means that the file has been updated (there has been one change). To make sure the album no longer exists, make another GET request! You should see:
"The album could not be found."
